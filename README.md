## Overview
This script is designed to test a search functionality on a web page, using different keywords provided by the data provider. Depending on the keyword, it may execute additional steps (such as logging in). TestNG will execute this test method three times, once for each keyword provided by the data provider, allowing for parameterized testing of the search functionality with different inputs.
